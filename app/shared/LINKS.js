Because everyone doesn't have an artistic soul or the ability to use CAO 3D software, Cults highlights the work of these designers who will make 3D printing accessible to all.Cults is a social network that brings together all the fans of the 3D printer world, so that they can interact with each other.  Cults also stands for generosity. Thanks to Promotions category, all 3D printing aficionados can find coupon codes to buy 3D printers, filaments, 3D scanners and many other accessories at the best prices.  So why such a name? Cults is an anacycle: read backwards it becomes St. Luc, patron saint of artists and sculptors. Read backwards you can also find .stl, the universal 3D format. In short, Cults, it seemed obvious to us."

Whether you're a 3D artist or not, you've probably seen TurboSquid models hundreds of times and didn't know it - which is fine with us! Our goal is to save customers the time of making a great 3D model, and instead let them spend their time on other areas of their production pipeline. Our customers tell us they save an average of 27 hours per model purchased, which can be a lifesaver in a time crunch.  TurboSquid's secondary mission is to focus the creativity of artists around the world to continually improve our library of models, while helping the artists who supply those models build a career as professional 3D modelers."
